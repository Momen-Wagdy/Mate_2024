We import the necessary libraries, namely RPi.GPIO for GPIO control and time for timing functions.
GPIO pin numbering mode is set to GPIO.BOARD.
We define the pin connected to the servo motor (servo_pin).
The PWM pin is set as an output.
A PWM instance is created with a frequency of 50 Hz.
The set_angle() function takes an angle and moves the servo accordingly. The angle is converted to the duty cycle required for the PWM signal.
Inside the while loop, the servo is moved to 0, 90, and 180 degrees sequentially with a one-second pause in between each movement.
The try...except block ensures that the GPIO and PWM resources are properly cleaned up when the program is terminated by a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C).


Remember to connect the signal wire of the servo motor to the designated GPIO pin (servo_pin),
and adjust the GPIO pin number according to your setup if necessary. 
Also, make sure you have the RPi.GPIO library installed (pip install RPi.GPIO).
